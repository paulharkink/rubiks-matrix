This project is used to master Kotlin, and born out of trying to solve an online algorithm challenge.
It is in no way intended to be production ready, but it might still be fun to look around.

The game consists of optimising the upper-left quarter of a matrix to contain the
highest possible sum, by rotating individual rows and columns.

The challenge is to come up with an algorithm that consistently finds the highest
possible outcome for a given matrix.

The project is built to be able to run in the challenge's Web IDE, 
which is why it uses a very old version of Kotlin and can not include
custom libraries.
